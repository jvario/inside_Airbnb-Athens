# I.  Introduction:

#### Project Overview:
The main objective of this project is to make a model that predicts the price of a listing, given its attributes. Several subtasks can be spawned from this objective. The main categories are:

	● Explore the given data. See what they describe and gather valuable insights about their properties.
	
	● Preprocess the data so that they can be used for predicting the listing price.
	
	● Model the data through the sklearn estimators or Azure services
	
#### Dataset:
The dataset is provided in a file called listings.csv and contains nominal information about the listings, like its neighbourhood, its description, amenities, bedrooms, bathrooms and more.
